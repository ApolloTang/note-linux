On starting a login shell (login in via ssh session) Ubuntu look for
login configuration file. Login configuration files are:

    .bash_profile
    .bash_login
    .profile

Ubuntu will search for one of these file in that order and
only reads and executes the first one it finds.

By default, .bash_profile and .bash_login are not present, so
on a clean installation of Ubuntu .profile is read.

On starting a non-login shell (when you open a terminal appcliation
such xterm) .bashrc is read. Your bash-related configuration
such as aliases, functions, your bash terminal appearances etc.
is specified in this files.

Since login shell does not read .bashrc you need the following script
in your login configuration file to read .bashrc in order to
configure your bash shell:

    # if running bash
    if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
        # include .bashrc if it exists
        if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
            . "$HOME/.bashrc"
        fi
    fi

Since the above script is located in .profile, you will use the following

    [[ -s ${HOME}/.profile ]] && source ${HOME}/.profile

to read .profile if you had added .bash_profile file to your freshly
installed Ubuntu.

Sourcing .profile means that every time you start a login shell
.bash_profile is executed, then .profile, and finally .bashrc.

Starting a non-login shell will just execute .bashrc as before.


Mac OS X
--------

Unlike Unix/Linus word, OSx terminal alpplications (Termial,
iTerm2, etc.) start as login shell. While a fresh Ubuntu come with
.profile, OSx comes with .bash_profile. So, instead of reading
.profile to source .bashrc, OSx reading .bash_parofile to .source
.bashrc.

That is the reason you see the following in OSx's .bash_profile:

    [[ -s ~/.bashrc ]] && source ~/.bashrc

So to recap: in OSx, whether you login via a GUI and open a terminal
application, ssh in, or login at a console, you'll be starting
a login shell which will execute .bash_profile and then source
.bashrc.

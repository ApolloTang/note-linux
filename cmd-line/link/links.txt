Hard links:

    $ ln file link

Soft links:

    $ ln -s item link

    where "item" is either a file or directory



Hard Links:
==========

limitations:
 1. Works only in own filesystem (cannot reference a file that
    is not on the same disk partition).
 2. Cannot reference a directory, only files

A directory listing containing a hard link shows no special indication
of the link.

When a hard link is deleted, the link is removed, but the contents
of the file itself continue to exist (that is, its space
is not deallocated) until all links to the file are deleted.

Modern practice prefers symbolic links, which over come the 2 limitation
metion above

inode
-----

    *inode* are id that point to content of the file

    to see inode for a file use:

        $ls -i

    File name with same inode means they point to same content




Symbolic links
==============

    Symbolic links overcome the two disadvantages of hard links:
        1. Hard links cannot span physical devices
        2. Hard links cannot reference directories, only files.
    Symbolic links are a special type of file that contains
    a text pointer to the target file or directory.

    If you write something to the symbolic link, the referenced file
    is also written to.

    When you delete a symbolic link, only the link is deleted, not
    the file itself.

    If the file is deleted, the link will continue to exist but will
    point to nothing.

    In many implementations, the ls command will display broken links
    in a distinguishing color, such as red, to reveal their presence.

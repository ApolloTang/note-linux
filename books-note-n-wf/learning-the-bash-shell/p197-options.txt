Setting Option:
===============

Setting the options is how you configure the behaviour of
your shell.

Some configurations are simply expressed in a value as on or
off. Configurations as such are the configure using the commands:
'set' or 'shopt'.

For example, if you want to use vi like editing mode
to type or edit your commands you enter:

    set -o vi

to unset vi mode you use "+" in lieu of "-":

    set +o vi

The use of plus "+" and minus "-" signs is counterintuitive:

    the '-' turns the named option on,
    while the '+' turns it off.

The reason for this incongruity is that the dash '-' is the conventional
UNIX way of specifying options to a command, while the use of
'+' is an afterthought.


Available options
-----------------

    The set option command takes the following format:

        set -o <option-name>

    The list the available <option-name>, do manpage for sh:

        man sh

    and search for 'option-name'.



To list the status of options:
------------------------------

        set -o

    bash will print a list of all options along with their settings.


Legacy
------
    The lagacy Bourne shell, does not use 'set -o' to configure shell
    behaviour, it uses a one letter abbreviations for this purpose,
    for example, to turn off pathname expansion, the lagacy Bourne shell uses:

        set -f

    which is equivilant to the following in bash shell

        set -o noglob



shopt
=====

ref: Search for 'shopt' in 'man sh'

'shopt' is a replacement for 'set -o' in bash 2.0.
It uses '-s' and '-u' instead of '+' or '-' to set or unset a shell
s behaviour properties. For example:

    shopt -o -s vi
    shopt -o -u vi

is identical to

    set -o vi
    set +o vi


Note that if you omit -o flag you will have access to additional
property not availalble to 'set -o'.  Search for 'shopt' in
'man sh' to see the complete list with describtion of what they do.

To print a list of value for all available options, simply type:

    'shopt -o'

Note that the items print out with above have additional property
not available to 'set -o'.  To use shopt to print a list of property
only access-able by 'set -o' use:

    'shopt -p -o'

The -p flag gives you a reusuable command snippet that can
be use to produce the current setting using 'set -/+o'.

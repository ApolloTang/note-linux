Setting Option:
===============

Setting the options is how you configure the behaviour of
your shell.


For example, if you want to use vi like editing mode
to type or edit your commands you enter:

    set -o vi

to unset vi mode you use "+" in lieu of "-"

The use of plus "+" and minus "-" signs is counterintuitive:

    the '-' turns the named option on,
    while the '+' turns it off.

The reason for this incongruity is that the dash '-' is the conventional
UNIX way of specifying options to a command, while the use of
'+' is an afterthought.


Available options
-----------------

    The set option command takes the following format:

        set -o <option-name>

    The list the available <option-name>, do manpage for sh:

        man sh

    and search for 'option-name'.



To list the status of options:
------------------------------

    set -o

bash will print a list of all options along with their settings.


Legacy
------
The lagacy Bourne shell, does not use 'set -o' to configure shell
behaviour, it uses a one letter abbreviations for this purpose,
for example, to turn off filename expansion, the lagacy Bourne shell uses:

    set -f

which is equivilant to the following in bash shell

    set -o noglob


options have a on-letter abbreviations that is synomyn to
to 'set -o <option>':

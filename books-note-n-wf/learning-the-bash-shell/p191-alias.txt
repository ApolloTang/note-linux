Where can you defined aliases?

    on the command line,
    in .bash_profile
    in .bashrc,

Alias has the form using this form:

  alias name=command

[!] Notice that there are no spaces on either side of the equal sign (=).

Eg:

    alias cdvoy='cd sipp/demo/animation/voyager'

    [!] note the quotes around command; necessary if the string
        being aliased consists of more than one word.



File expansion if alias
------------------------
wildcards and other special characters can be used in the aliased
command i.e., on the right side of the equal sign.

wildcards and other special characters cannot be used in the
names of aliases, i.e., on the left side of the equal sign.

Eg:

    alias printall='pr * | lpr'


Recursive Nature of alias
-------------------------
Aliases are recursive, which means that it is possible to alias
an alias. However, while being recursive infinite loop will not
occurs because only the first word of the replacement text is
checked for further aliasing; if that word is identical to the
alias being expanded, it is not expanded a second time.

Therefore

  alias ls='ls -l'

will work as expected (typing ls produces a long list with permissions
sizes, owners, etc.), while in more meaningless situations such as:

  alias listfile=ls
  alias ls=listfile

the alias listfile is ignored.

Order of configuration files Ubuntu look for on login shell:

    .bash_profile
    .bash_login  (derived from csh's .login)
    .profile     (derived from Bourne shell and Korn shell's .profile)

On a clean installation only .profile exist.

You can put your bash specific commands in .bash_profile, and at the end
of .bash_profile you source .profile.

With this set up when you switch to Borune shell, only .profile
is read while .bash_profile is skipped. And when you switch back to bash shell,
bash specific command will be executed in addition to commands in .profile
which are executable for both Bourne and bash.

Similar approach won't work for csh because of different in syntax between
csh and bash.

Since login shell does not read .bashrc, you can source .bashrc in
.profile. So:

On log in, .bash_profile will load .profile which in turn will load
.bashrc.

Variable name:
  • Case sensitive
  • Consist of a combination of letter and underscore
  • Assignment operator is '='
  • Note that no space are permitted on either side of '='





Special variable inside script:

    $0           is the file name of current script
    $1, ..., $n  are the nth argument passed into the script
    $@           holds a space delimited string of all arguments passed to
                 the script


Encapsulating the variable name with ${} is used to avoid ambiguity.

    $ a=hello123

    $ echo "XXX ${a} XXX"
    XXX hello123 XXX


Extra white space will be removed from a string:

    $ e='a b     c     '
           ^^^^  ^^^^-----------extra space will be removed

    $ echo $e 'xxx'
    a b c xxx
       ^ ^------- only one space left

To preserve space, surrround the variable with double quote:

    $ echo "$e" 'xxx'
    a b    c     xxx



Substitution:
To assign the result of a command to variable, use back-ticks or $():

    $ a=`echo hello`
    $ echo $a
    hello


    $ b=$(echo bye)
    $ echo $b
    bye

    In otherword, back-ticks or $() capture the result of cammand execution.

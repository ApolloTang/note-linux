Session
=======
Sessions are groups of windows. Each session is kind of like spaces in OSX.
A typical workflow is to isolate projects to a single session, and name the session
by the name of project, and then configure the default folder to project folder,
and environment to that project, etc.

tmux new -s <session-name>          // Start a new session, and go into it.
tmux new -s <session-name> -d       // Start a detash new session (New session in background)

tmux ls                             // List runing session
[prefix]d                           // Detash (exit not kill) a session
tmux attach -t <session-name>       // Attach tmux and set target session to <session-name>

tmux kill-session -t <sesion-name>  // Kill a session

[prefix]s                           // switch between session
[prefix]$                           // rename session



Window
======

Session can have child sessions called window

tmux new -s <session-name> -n <window-name>   // New session, with name for session and window

[prefix]c      // creat a window
[prefix],      // rename current window
$exit          // close current window
[prefix]&      // close current window with confirmation


If you never give a name to a window, its name will changes based
on the application that is currently running.

[prefix]n           // switch to next window
[prefix]p           // switch to previous window
[prefix]<window id> // switch to window by id

[prefix]f           // find a window
[prefix]m           // display a menu of window


Split window into panes
=======================

Is the new pane, session or window ?

[prefix]%  // verticlally split the screen, focus on the new pane and
           // start a new session.

[prefix]"  // like [prefix]% but horizontally.

[prefix]o            // cycle through panes.
[prefix]<arrow-key>  // moments through panes.




[prefix]?  // list all binding

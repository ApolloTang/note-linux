^M or \r\n

Control-M (^M) is carriage return without linefeed.
it can be produced by 
echo “Hello <ctrl + v> <ctrl +m> World” > myfile.txt

see: http://www.thelinuxtips.com/tag/od-command/


The End of Line character in Unix/Linux is \n. 
Windows End of Line Character is \r\n or (^M)

use: od -Ad -c myfile.txt
this will display offset in decimal (-Ad) and content in ASCII (-c)

		$ ./myscript.sh
		ksh: ./myscript.sh: No such file or directory
		$ head -1 myscript.sh
		#!/bin/sh
		$ which sh
		/bin/sh

	I immediately thought there is an issue interpreting the first line. “od” (Octal Dump) command came to my rescue. You can see here:

		$ od -ac myscript.sh |head
		+ od -ac myscript.sh
		+ head
		0000000 # ! / b i n / s h cr nl cr nl # sp T
		# ! / b i n / s h \r \n \r \n # T
		0000020 h i s sp u t i l i t y sp a s k sp
		h i s u t i l i t y a s k
		0000040 f o r sp u s e r n a m e , sp p a
		f o r u s e r n a m e , p a
		0000060 s s w o r d , sp a n d sp n u m b
		s s w o r d , a n d n u m b
		0000100 e r sp o f sp t h r e a d s cr nl #
		e r o f t h r e a d s \r \n #
		$

	As you can see above (the characters \r\n), there are ^M (Control + M) characters after the /bin/sh, So obviously the shell is unable to read that as the shell interpreter. This is a common problem when we move scripts from Windows machines to Linux/Unix machines.

	The End of Line character is Unix/Linux is \n. If there are two characters, such as \r\n, then it is the Windows End of Line Character.

	There are many solutions to fix this problem:

		1. In vi edition, you can search for ^M characters and delete them

			:%s/^M//g

			To get the ^M in vi edition, you need to press Ctrl+V and Ctrl+M.
	
		2. In Linux, there is an option called “:set fileformat=unix” – Set this mode and save the file.

		3. During the file transfer from Windows, set the mode as ASCII. 
			Most of the FTP clients do this automatically for extensions .sh .txt etc. If not, you need to do that.

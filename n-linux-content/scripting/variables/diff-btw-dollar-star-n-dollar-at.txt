"$@" expands to properly quoted arguments and "$*" makes all arguments into a single argument. Take this for example:

    #!/bin/bash

    function print_args_at {
        printf "%s\n" "$@"
    }

    function print_args_star {
        printf "%s\n" "$*"
    }

    print_args_at "one" "two three" "four"
    print_args_star "one" "two three" "four"


Then:

    $ ./printf.sh 
    one
    two three
    four
    one two three four
